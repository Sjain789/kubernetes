The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to create few jobs in Kubernetes cluster. 
They might come up with some real scripts/commands to use, but for now they are preparing the templates and testing the jobs with dummy commands. 
Please create a job template as per details given below:
1.	Create a job countdown-devops.
2.	The spec template should be named as countdown-devops (under metadata), and the container should be named as container-countdown-devops
3.	Use image fedora with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e fedora:latest, and restart policy should be Never.
4.	Use command for i in 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ; do echo $i ; done
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
