We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. 
There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. 
The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.

1. Create a pod named volume-share-devops.

2. For first container, use image centos with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e centos:latest, 
container should be named as volume-container-devops-1, and run a command '/bin/bash', '-c' and 'sleep 10000'. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/media.

3. For second container, use image centos with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e centos:latest, 
container should be named as volume-container-devops-2, and run a command '/bin/bash', 'c' and 'sleep 10000'. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/apps.

4. Volumes to be named as volume-share and use emptyDir: { }.

5. After creating pods, exec into the first container volume-container-devops-1, 
and create a file media.txt with content Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries! under the mount path of first container i.e /tmp/media.

6. The file media.txt should be present under the mounted path /tmp/apps of second container volume-container-devops-2 as they are using shared volumes.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
