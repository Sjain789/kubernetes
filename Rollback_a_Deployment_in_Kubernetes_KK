This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. 
Recently on of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to rollback the recent release.
There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment --revision=2
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment --revision=1
kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment --to-revision=1
